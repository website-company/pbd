                            <h1>About Palm Bay Daycare</h1>
                            <p>We are a licensed daycare center that has room for everybody. We take all ages from 6 weeks old all the way up to 12 years old. We have an awesome team with lots of experience with a passion to teach children. Our aftercare program includes heling children with their home work so you can spend time with after school without having to do homework. </p>
                            <p>We except ELC which is a government funded program that assist parents with the financial burden of paying for child care. ELC also covers our VPK program, which is where we are getting your little ones ready for kindergarten. We also have a food program which we provide breakfast, lunch and 2 snacks per day. If your children have favorite food interest, just let us know and we can try to include it in our menu. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask or say something because we have an open-door policy. We are always open for suggestion's, therefore if you have any; we would love to hear them. </p>
